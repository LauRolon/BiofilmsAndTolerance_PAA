# _Pseudomonadaceae_ increased the tolerance of _Listeria monocytogenes_ to sanitizers in multi-species biofilms
Voloshchuk, O., Rolon, M.L., Bartlett, K.V., Mendez-Acevedo, M., LaBorde, L.F., Kovac, J. _Pseudomonadaceae_ increased the tolerance of _Listeria monocytogenes_ to sanitizers in multi-species biofilms [Under Review in Food Microbiology]


## Data analysis workflow:
1. Culture-based microbiology data analyses (tolerance curves, MIC)

## Supplemental Files
1. Inactivation models for BAC at 200 ppm
2. Inactivation models for PAA at 250 ppm
3. Inactivation models for PAA at 500 ppm

For these tables, the following accronyms were used:
-, indicates that the log linear with tail or Weibull models could not be fitted due to rapid die-off of_ L. monocytogenes _in the assemblage.
p, dimensionless shape parameter describing the upward or downward concavity of the curve. 
δ, time scale parameter representing the time required for the first logarithmic reduction of microbial population. 
AIC, Akaike’s Information Criterium. 
RMSE, Root Mean Square Error. 
D, decimal reduction time
Y0, initial concentration of _L. monocytogenes_ is logMPN/peg
Tail, constant after log linear inactivation
